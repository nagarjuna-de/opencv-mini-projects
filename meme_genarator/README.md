# Meme Generator
#### Introduction  
The idea behind this project is to create `Spider-meme Image` and to add our own content need to make a meme.  
For this project, I used Opencv library.
  
#### What to Install
pip install Opencv-python == 4.5.5  
pip install matplotlib == 3.2.2  
pip install numpy == 1.14.6  

#### How to use it  
1. First Install the required Packages.
2. There was a folder with name `images` under the parent folder.
3. Place your spiderman-meme images in that folder.
4. Run `main.py` file
5. It gonna ask you `Enter the image name with extension:` for spiderman image to make meme.  
6. Enter the image name placed in the `images folder`.
7. A popup opens and displays your uploaded image
8. Press any button on your keyboard to close the popup.
9. The `spider_meme()` function done the job and gives the required output/meme.
10. A popup opens and displays your final meme image
11. Press any button on your keyboard to close the popup.

Blank Image  
<img src= ".\images\demo1.png" alt="Image with a Green Screen Background. "/>    
  
Meme Image.  
<img src= ".\images\demo2.png" alt="Image with a Background."/>    

#### Future updates
Now, the content in the meme is in the code.
In further update the user will enter the required content in the terminal itself.
So, the final meme with user required content.
