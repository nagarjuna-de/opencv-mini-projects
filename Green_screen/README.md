# Green Screen mini project
#### Introduction  
The idea behind this project is to `Mask out green background` in the image1 and `Add it to another background` of image2.  
For this project, I used Opencv library.
  
#### What to Install
pip install Opencv-python == 4.5.5  
pip install matplotlib == 3.2.2  
pip install numpy == 1.14.6  

#### How to use it  
1. First Install the required Packages.
2. There was a folder with name `images` under the parent folder with green screen images and background images.
3. Place your images in that folder.
4. Run `main.py` file
5. It gonna ask you `Enter the image name with extension:` for green screen image and background image.  
6. Enter the image name placed in the `images folder`.
7. The `green_screen()` function done the job and gives the required output from the 2 images.
8. A popup opens and displays your combined image
9. Press any button on your keyboard to close the popup.
