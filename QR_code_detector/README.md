# OpenCV QRCodeDetector()  
#### Introduction  
The idea behind this project is to `Detect` and `extract` the information of a QR code in the image.  
For this project, I used Opencv library to detect and extract information from QR codes.  
  
#### What to Install
pip install Opencv-python == 4.5.5  
pip install matplotlib == 3.2.2  
pip install numpy == 1.14.6  

#### How to use it  
1. First Install the required Packages.
2. There was a folder with name `images` under the parent folder(QR_code_detector).
3. Place your QR code images in that folder.
4. Run `main.py` file
5. It gonna ask you `Enter the image name with extension:`.  
6. Enter the image name placed in the `images folder`
7. A popup opens and displays your uploaded image
8. Press any button on your keyboard to go further.
9. If QR code is detected in the image, it prints the `information behind the QR code` in terminal.
10. Another pop up opens and displays/highlight the detected QR code.
11. If no QR code detected then it prints `No QR code Detected`
